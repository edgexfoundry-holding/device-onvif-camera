- Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS
- ONVIF-compliant Camera

>**NOTE:** The instructions in this guide were developed and tested using Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and the Tapo C200 Pan/Tilt Wi-Fi Camera, referred to throughout this document as the **Tapo C200 Camera**. However, the software may work with other Linux distributions and ONVIF-compliant cameras. Refer to our [list of tested cameras for more information](../ONVIF-protocol.md#tested-onvif-cameras)

**Time to Complete**

10-20 minutes

**Other Requirements**

You must have administrator (sudo) privileges to execute the user guide commands.

## How It Works
For an explanation of the architecture, see the [User Guide](../../README.md#how-it-works).

## Dependencies
The software has dependencies, including Git, Docker, Docker Compose, and assorted tools. Follow the instructions below to install any dependency that is not already installed. 

### Install Git
Install Git from the official repository as documented on the [Git SCM](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) site.

1. Update installation repositories:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

2. Add the Git repository:
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa -y

To enable running Docker commands without the preface of sudo, add the user to the Docker group. Then run Docker with the `hello-world` test.

1. Create Docker group:
   ```bash
   sudo groupadd docker
   ```
   >**NOTE:** If the group already exists, `groupadd` outputs a message: **groupadd: group `docker` already exists**. This is OK.

2. Add User to group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

3. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

4. To verify the Docker installation, run `hello-world`:

   ```bash
   docker run hello-world
   ```
   A **Hello from Docker!** greeting indicates successful installation.

   ```bash
   Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally

<details>
<summary><strong>Run the Service using Docker</strong></summary>

   1. Navigate to the EdgeX `compose-builder` directory:

      ```bash
      cd edgex-compose/compose-builder/
      ```

   2. Run EdgeX with the microservice in non-secure mode:

      ```bash
      make run no-secty ds-onvif-camera
      ```
   
   3. Run EdgeX with the microservice in secure mode:

      ```bash
      make run ds-onvif-camera
      ```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Run the Service natively</summary><strong>

<br/>

>**NOTE:** Go version 1.18+ is required to run natively.

<br/>

   1. Navigate to the EdgeX `compose-builder` directory:

      ```bash
      cd edgex-compose/compose-builder/
      ```

   1. Navigate out of the `edgex-compose` directory to the `device-onvif-camera` directory:

      ```bash
      cd device-onvif-camera
      ```

   1. Run the service:

      ```bash
      make run 
      ```

</details>

## Verify Service and Device Profiles

1. Check the status of the container:

   ```bash 
   docker ps
   ```

   The status column will indicate if the container is running and how long it has been up.

   Example Output:

   ```docker
   CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                                         COMMAND                  CREATED       STATUS          PORTS                                                                                         NAMES
   33f9c5ecb70e   edgexfoundry/device-onvif-camera:0.0.0-dev    "/device-onvif-camerâ€¦"   7 weeks ago   Up 48 minutes   127.0.0.1:59985->59985/tcp                                                                    edgex-device-onvif-camera
   ```

2. Check that the device service is added to EdgeX:

   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:59881/api/v2/deviceservice/name/device-onvif-camera | jq .
   ```
   Successful:
   ```json
      {
         "apiVersion": "v2",
         "statusCode": 200,
         "service": {
            "created": 1657227634593,
            "modified": 1657291447649,
            "id": "e1883aa7-f440-447f-ad4d-effa2aeb0ade",
            "name": "device-onvif-camera",
            "baseAddress": "http://edgex-device-onvif-camera:59984",
            "adminState": "UNLOCKED"
         }         
      }
   ```
   Unsuccessful:
   ```json
   {
      "apiVersion": "v2",
      "message": "fail to query device service by name device-onvif-camer",
      "statusCode": 404
   }
   ```


3. Check that the device profile is added:

   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:59881/api/v2/deviceprofile/name/onvif-camera | jq -r '"profileName: " + '.profile.name' + "\nstatusCode: " + (.statusCode|tostring)'

   ```
   Successful:
   ```bash
   profileName: onvif-camera
   statusCode: 200
   ```
   Unsuccessful:
   ```bash
   profileName: 
   statusCode: 404
   ```
   >**NOTE:** The `jq -r` option is used to reduce the size of the displayed response. The entire device profile with all resources can be seen by removing `-r '"profileName: " + '.profile.name' + "\nstatusCode: " + (.statusCode|tostring)', and replacing it with '.'`

## Manage Devices
Follow these instructions to update devices.

### Curl Commands

#### Add Device

>**NOTE:** The scripts used here are from the device-onvif-camera repository.  

<details>
<summary><strong>Manually</strong></summary>

1. Edit the information to appropriately match the camera. The fields `Address`, `MACAddress` and `Port` should match that of the camera:

   ```bash
   curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json'  \
   http://localhost:59881/api/v2/device \
   -d '[
            {
               "apiVersion": "v2",
               "device": {
                  "name":"Camera001",
                  "serviceName": "device-onvif-camera",
                  "profileName": "onvif-camera",
                  "description": "My test camera",
                  "adminState": "UNLOCKED",
                  "operatingState": "UP",
                  "protocols": {
                     "Onvif": {
                        "Address": "10.0.0.0",
                        "Port": "10000",
                        "MACAddress": "aa:bb:cc:11:22:33",
                        "FriendlyName":"Default Camera"
                     },
                     "CustomMetadata": {
                        "Location":"Front door"
                     }
                  }
               }
            }
   ]'
   ```

   Example Output: 
   ```bash
   [{"apiVersion":"v2","statusCode":201,"id":"fb5fb7f2-768b-4298-a916-d4779523c6b5"}]

<summary><strong>Auto Discovery</strong></summary>  

<br/>

ONVIF devices support WS-Discovery, which is a mechanism that supports probing a network to find ONVIF capable devices.  Refer to [How does WS-Discovery work?](https://github.com/EdgeX-Camera-Management/device-onvif-camera/blob/main/doc/ws-discovery.md) and [Auto Discovery](https://github.com/EdgeX-Camera-Management/device-onvif-camera/blob/main/doc/auto-discovery.md) for more information auto-discovery mechanism.  The following steps will enable auto discovery using the `netscan` method _after_ the service has been deployed.

> **NOTE:** Ensure that the cameras are all installed and configured before attempting discovery.  

1. Navigate to the `device-onvif-camera` directory.
   
2. Set the DiscoverySubnets by running `bin/configure-subnets.sh`.

Device discovery is triggered by the device service. Once the device service starts, it will discover the Onvif camera(s) at the specified interval.
> **Note:** You can also manually trigger discovery using this command: `curl -X POST http://<service-host>:59984/api/v2/discovery`

</details>

<br/>

1. Map credentials using the `map-credentials.sh` script.  
   a. Navigate to the `device-onvif-camera` directory  
   b. Run `bin/map-credentials.sh`    
   c. Select `(Create New)`
      ![](../images/create_new.png)
   d. Enter the Secret Path to associate with these credentials  
      ![](../images/secret_path.png)
   e. Enter the username  
      ![](../images/set_username.png)
   f. Enter the password  
      ![](../images/set_password.png)
   g. Choose the Authentication Mode  
      ![](../images/auth_mode.png)
   h. Assign one or more MAC Addresses to the credential group  
      ![](../images/assign_mac.png)

      >**NOTE:** The MAC address field can be left blank if the SecretPath from the "Enter Secret Path ..." step above, is set to the DefaultSecretPath (credentials001) from the [cmd/res/configuration.toml](../../cmd/res/configuration.toml).  

   i. Learn more about updating credentials [here](../utility-scripts.md)

   ```  
    <a name="verify-device"></a>  

2. Verify device(s) have been successfully added to core-metadata:

   ```bash
   curl -s http://localhost:59881/api/v2/device/all | jq -r '"deviceName: " + '.devices[].name''
   ```

   Example Output:
   ```bash
   deviceName: Camera001
   deviceName: device-onvif-camera
   ```
   >**NOTE:** The device with name `device-onvif-camera` is a stand-in device and can be ignored.  
   >**NOTE:** The `jq -r` option is used in the curl command to reduce the size of the displayed response. The entire device with all information can be seen by removing `-r '"deviceName: " + '.devices[].name'', and replacing it with '.'`  

#### Delete Device

   ```bash
   curl -X 'DELETE' \
   'http://localhost:59881/api/v2/device/name/<device name>' \
   -H 'accept: application/json' 
   ```

### Use EdgeX Console to Verify Device Services, Devices, and Device Profiles
1. Visit http://localhost:4000 to go to the dashboard for EdgeX Console GUI:

   ![EdgeXConsoleDashboard](../images/EdgeXDashboard.png)
   <p align="left">
      <i>Figure 5: EdgeX Console Dashboard</i>
   </p>

2. To get device status information, click on the tabs **Device Services**, **Devices**, or **Device Profiles**:

   ![EdgeXConsoleDeviceServices](../images/EdgeXDeviceServices.png)
   <p align="left">
      <i>Figure 6: EdgeX Console Device Service List</i>
   </p>

   ![EdgeXConsoleDeviceList](../images/EdgeXDeviceList.png)
   <p align="left">
      <i>Figure 7: EdgeX Console Device List</i>

   ![EdgeXConsoleDeviceProfileList](../images/EdgeXDeviceProfiles.png)
   <p align="left">
      <i>Figure 8: EdgeX Console Device Profile List</i>
   </p>

## Execute GetStreamURI Command through EdgeX

1. <a name="step1"></a>Get the profile token by executing the `GetProfiles` command:

   >**NOTE:** Make sure to replace `Camera001` in all the commands below, with the deviceName returned in the ["Verify device(s) have been successfully added to core-metadata"](#verify-device) step above.  

   ```bash
   curl -s http://0.0.0.0:59882/api/v2/device/name/Camera001/Profiles | jq -r '"profileToken: " + '.event.readings[].objectValue.Profiles[].Token''
   ```
   Example Output: 

   ```bash
   profileToken: profile_1
   profileToken: profile_2
   ```

2. To get the RTSP URI from the ONVIF device, execute the `GetStreamURI` command, using a profileToken found in [step 1](#step1):  
   In this example, `profile_1` is the profileToken:  

   ```bash
      curl -s "http://0.0.0.0:59882/api/v2/device/name/Camera001/StreamUri?jsonObject=$(base64 -w 0 <<< '{
         "StreamSetup" : {
            "Stream" : "RTP-Unicast",
            "Transport" : {
               "Protocol" : "RTSP"
            }
         },
         "ProfileToken": "profile_1"
      }')" | jq -r '"streamURI: " + '.event.readings[].objectValue.MediaUri.Uri''
   ```
   
   Example Output:

   ```bash
   streamURI: rtsp://192.168.86.34:554/stream1
   ``` 

3. Stream the RTSP stream. 

   ffplay can be used to stream. The command follows this format: 
   
   `ffplay -rtsp_transport tcp "rtsp://<user>:<password>@<IP address>:<port>/<streamname>"`.

   Using the `streamURI` returned from the previous step, run ffplay:
   
   ```bash
   ffplay -rtsp_transport tcp "rtsp://admin:Password123@192.168.86.34:554/stream1"
   ```

   >**NOTE:** While the `streamURI` returned did not contain the username and password, those credentials are required in order to correctly authenticate the request and play the stream. Therefore, it is included in both the VLC and ffplay streaming examples.  
   >**NOTE:** If the password uses special characters, you must use percent-encoding.  

4. To shut down ffplay, use the ctrl-c command.

## Shutting Down
To stop all EdgeX services (containers), execute the `make down` command:

1. Navigate to the `edgex-compose/compose-builder` directory.
1. To shut down, run this command
   ```bash
   make down
   ```
1. To shut down and delete all volumes, run this command
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
   >**NOTE:** Since this command deletes all volumes, you will need to rerun the [Add Device](#add-device) steps to re-enable your device(s). 

## Summary and Next Steps
This guide demonstrated how to:

- deploy EdgeX with the ONVIF Device Service 
- use the EdgeX REST APIs and the ONVIF Device Service to acquire the camera's RTSP stream
